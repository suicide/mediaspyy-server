# MediaSpyy Server

Server backend for the MediaSpyy Chrome extension. It persists media information.

## SBT config

## Build

```bash
./sbt clean compile
```

## TODO

- Load media info from other sources -> URL problem
- frontend for history: simple 'static' html/css/ts site that reads data from given json
    bootstrap alternatives?
- alternative deployment to heroku
- have a look at ipfs
